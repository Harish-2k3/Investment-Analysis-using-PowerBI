# Investment-Analysis-using-PowerBI
I completed an investment analysis project using Power BI. Key tasks included data exploration, gender-based analysis, objective analysis, investment duration and frequency analysis, reasons for investment, and sources of information. These insights were combined into a comprehensive dashboard to support strategic decision-making.
